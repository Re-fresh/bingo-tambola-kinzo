A **n** player game with one moderator. Moderator generates 10 random numbers having range 0-100,  Each player is given a deck of cards containing 10 random numbers (between 0 - 100 or custom). If the number generated by the moderator matches the card for some of the players cards then the players will have to scratch that card. Every player sleeps for some random time, this ensures that only one player can win and the game isn't biased. The player who manages to scratch 3 cards first, wins the game. Moderator can only generate the next number, when all players have read the current number.  The code will print "Nobody won" if every player loses.
